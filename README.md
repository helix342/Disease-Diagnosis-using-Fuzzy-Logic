# Disease-Diagnosis-using-Fuzzy-Logic
A program that diagnoses diseases based on fuzzy logic with the inputs given by the user in the form of symptoms that are manipulated the answer is derived using Fuzzy Logic and Machine Learning Algorithms.

- In this code, we've created a fuzzy logic system to diagnose a disease based on the symptoms provided. We've defined membership functions for symptoms and for the likelihood of having the disease. We've also defined a rule to infer the likelihood of the disease based on the symptoms. You can extend the system with more rules and refine the membership functions based on the characteristics of your dataset.

- This program was created as part of a assignment for the machine learning algorithms course in my college.
